Face Mask Detector using OpenCV and Keras

Tutorial Referenced: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-face-mask-detector-with-opencv-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/

The MobileVNet 2 classifier is used along with a haarcascade file for face detection. 
Keras is used to train and run the data.

# Project Goals

The goal of the project was to get familiar with the basics of image-based machine learning algorithms by implementing a real time face mask detector that captures and analyzes infromation through a live video feed.

# Basic info
## What is a CNN
CNNs are Neural Networks used for the purpose of analyzing images. Traditional Neural Networks work with defined inputs and outputs along with a neural layer in-between. CNNs on the other hand, links neurons to pixels that are close together so it understands how the pixels in an image are related.

##OpenCV
OpenCV is an incredibly useful Python library aimed at handling real time computer vison. In this project, OpenCV was used to handle data from the video feed.
